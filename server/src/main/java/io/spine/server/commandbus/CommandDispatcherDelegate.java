/**
 * A common interface for objects which need to dispatch the
 * {@linkplain io.spine.base.Command commands}, but are unable to implement
 * the {@linkplain io.spine.server.commandbus.CommandDispatcher CommandDispatcher}.
 *
 * <p>A typical example of a {@code CommandDispatcherDelegate} usage is a routine, which
 * simultaneously dispatches different types of {@linkplain com.google.protobuf.Message messages}
 * in addition to {@code Command}s.
 *
 * <p>In this case such a class would have to implement several
 * {@linkplain io.spine.server.bus.MessageDispatcher MessageDispatcher} child interfaces
 * (such as {@linkplain io.spine.server.commandbus.CommandDispatcher CommandDispatcher} or
 * {@linkplain io.spine.server.event.EventDispatcher EventDispatcher}). However, it is impossible
 * to implement the same {@link io.spine.server.bus.MessageDispatcher#getMessageClasses()
 * getMessageClasses()} method several times with the different types of {@code MessageClass}es
 * returned.
 *
 * <p>The same interference takes place in attempt to implement
 * {@link io.spine.server.bus.MessageDispatcher#dispatch(io.spine.envelope.MessageEnvelope)
 * MessageDispatcher#dispatch(MessageEnvelope)} method with the different types of
 * {@code MessageEnvelope}s dispatches simultaneously.
 *
 * <p>That's why unlike {@linkplain io.spine.server.bus.MessageDispatcher MessageDispatcher},
 * this interface defines its own contract for declaring the dispatched
 * {@linkplain CommandClass command classes}, which does not interfere with the
 * {@code MessageDispatcher} API.
